<h3>
The White Canoe.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
There's a whisper of life in the grey dead trees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a murmuring wash on the shore,<br />
And a breath of the South in the loitering breeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell that a winter is o'er.<br />
While free, at last, from its fetters of ice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river is clear and blue,<br />
And cries with a tremulous quivering voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the launch of the White Canoe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Oh, gently the ripples will kiss her side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tenderly bear her on;<br />
For she is the wandering phantom bride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the river she rests upon;<br />
She is loved with a love that cannot forget,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A passion so strong and true,<br />
That never a billow has risen yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To peril the White Canoe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
So come when the moon is enthroned in the sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the echoes are sweet and low,<br />
And Nature is full of the mystery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That none but her children know;<br />
Come, taste of the rest that the weary crave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is only revealed to a few:<br />
When there's trouble on shore, there's peace on the wave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afloat in the White Canoe.<br />
</p>

<h3>
A Vision.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
To-night, sweetheart, when all about me lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shadow deep the wood,<br />
I felt my soul within me reel and sway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pulse my sluggish blood,<br />
As when along a quiet land-locked bay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swells some resistless flood.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
My spirit leapt from out its earthly prison,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher and ever higher,<br />
Until it reached those barriers Elysian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the eternal fire<br />
Creates one great impassable division<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twixt us and our desire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Up, till it left the regions of the night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sorrow and of fear,<br />
Emerging into that soft mellow light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That radiance pure and clear,<br />
Where Love reigns all supreme, and all is bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only Love be near.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
There through sweet meadows, on by brimming streams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered my soul at will,<br />
And saw such forms as haunt our loveliest dreams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, waking, haunt us still;<br />
Voices like music, smiles like sunny beams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in a rippling rill.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But ah! my soul saw one supremely fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One form the most divine,<br />
One face enhaloed all with golden hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In beauty most benign,<br />
Surpassing all the perfect beauty there:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart of my heart, 'twas thine!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
My soul went forth, but all grew strange and dim&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meadow and stream were gone&mdash;<br />
I heard a sound as of a far-off hymn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By night winds softly blown;<br />
Then all around me seemed to sink and swim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am here alone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
A Question.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Pale Moon, whose tranquil orb resplendent sails<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethereal main; thy curved prow<br />
For ever braving the celestial gales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serene and slow:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Myriads of Stars, that ever dot the blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great vault of heaven: eyes that keep<br />
Eternal watch, unshaken, strong, and true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet never sleep:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Ye southern Zephyrs, redolent with balm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of myrtle, orange, and the rose;<br />
Blowing from islands where the fronded palm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In beauty grows:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Wind of the North, whose trumpet voice can shake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shuddering echoes of the cave;<br />
Storm-born, blast-driven; thou, whose breath doth make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty wave:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Perpetual Fire, whose never-dying flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumes the glowing heart of earth,<br />
Until a wide destruction shall proclaim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second birth:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Tell me, oh! mighty concourse, have ye seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this great infinity<br />
Of worlds unborn and planets that have been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place for me?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
Confession, Creed, and Prayer.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Silent around me a cathedral dim,<br />
Still throbbing with the echoes of a hymn,<br />
Lifted its ghostly arches, great and grim;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Slowly the worshippers had filed away;<br />
Untenanted the vacant cloisters lay;<br />
As even followed on the steps of day;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But one remained, who bent his reverent head<br />
Where graven figures slumber with the dead,<br />
And spake with faltering accents, and he said:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Light, light, more light; Great Father, give me light;<br />
I cannot see my way, so dark the night;<br />
My finite heart shrinks from the infinite.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Anon the shadow lifts: my straining eyes<br />
One moment see that which before me lies;<br />
This fades, and new-born hope within me dies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"I looked for sunshine, yet there cometh rain;<br />
My sweetest pleasure turneth into pain:<br />
I would sink back to nothingness again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Beliefs are but perpetual ideas,<br />
The gospel worketh only on my fears,<br />
In bitterness and sorrow, void of tears;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"In one God I believe, eternally<br />
Omnipotent and present, and that He<br />
Rules Heaven and Hell, the earth, the sky, the sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"As carnal life by carnal love is given,<br />
So life divine by love divine is proven,<br />
Of which the fountain head is God in Heaven.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"That since each body is the fleshly home<br />
Of something better, something not our own,<br />
So God all faults but foulness will condone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"For I believe impurity is sin<br />
Against the Spirit life that dwells within<br />
Creating Father and created men;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"That every soul is judged true and well<br />
According to the light that on it fell:<br />
No light, no judgment; strong light, Heaven or Hell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"All this and more; Great Father, I have heard<br />
Of Thy dear Son; my heart expectant stirred<br />
To welcome Him, confessing I had erred.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Nay, said humanity within me, nay,<br />
I cannot grasp this mystery, so stay<br />
Until I comprehend, and I obey:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"I would, yet cannot&mdash;herein lies my grief.<br />
Thy Son spake comfort to the dying thief,<br />
So speak to me and help mine unbelief."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Here the voice faltered, ceased.  God, can it be<br />
The morn has dawned on him and not on me?<br />
Is this the Publican, I Pharisee?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
To My Pipe.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Others their nectar from the goblet sip;<br />
I draw sweet solace from thine amber lip.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
"A feast of reason and a flow of soul"<br />
Lurk in the perfumed vapors of thy bowl.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Some scoff, and say I err from nature's rules&mdash;<br />
Tobacco's poison; but, friend, some are fools.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
If times are hard, no comrade like to thee;<br />
If prosperous, thou'rt the priest of jollity.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Browned in my service, silver-rimmed through age,<br />
Thy smouldering fire, reflection's heritage;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
When the day comes, old friend, and I'm dead broke,<br />
Then just one puff&mdash;we'll both go up in smoke.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
Supposing.<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
HE.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Supposing that when we were wed, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And two were reduced into one,<br />
That a hot-tempered word should be said, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thoughtlessly mischief be done;<br />
That you should be proud and offended.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should be heartless and cold:<br />
Do you think that our peace would be ended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale of our happiness told?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Supposing that children should come, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a girl and a boy,<br />
And my heart should go forth to the one, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other your pride and your joy;<br />
Do you think that although so divided,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we still in our plans could agree,<br />
And always the best be provided,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our dear ones by you and by me?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Supposing that times were so bad, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ends couldn't possibly meet&mdash;<br />
And I should get weary and sad, love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you were still hopeful and sweet;<br />
Do you think you'd inspirit and cheer me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And help me to weather the gale,<br />
That your presence would ever be near me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your courage not falter or fail?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
SHE.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Supposing, you darling old stupid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all this should happen, and more,<br />
Do you think that the youngster called Cupid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would fly, and his reign would be o'er?<br />
No; the bond of affection would stay, dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent of pocket or purse;<br />
As a wife I would honor, obey, dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love you "for better for worse."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
The Widower's Lullaby.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Dost remember, dear one, floating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a moonlit silver sea;<br />
Stars above us, depths beneath us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows covering you and me?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Ever drifting, spellbound, silent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down a shimmering track of light;<br />
While around the gloom was throbbing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mystery of night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Mute our lips; what need of speaking?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our heart chords were as tense<br />
As a bowstring stretched to breaking:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every look was eloquence.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Till my soul had burst its barriers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I told you my desire;<br />
Told of love, undying passion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong as ocean, pure as fire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
You nor moved, nor sighed, nor answered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale your cheek was as your dress,<br />
But the golden lashes drooping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave response, and it was "Yes."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
That was five long years ago, dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you hear me as I speak?<br />
For again I see the lashes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling on a pallid cheek.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Still, and ah! so silent sleeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless you take your rest;<br />
I've your pledge of love beside me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your image in my breast.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Just one golden head you gave me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little one with eyes of blue;<br />
See, she nestles to my shoulder:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darling, can you see us two?<br />
</p>

<h3>
LULLABY.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep, little one, sleep,<br />
Safe and strong is thy father's arm,<br />
He will guard thee from every harm,<br />
Soothe thee with kisses soft and warm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep, little one, sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep, little one, sleep;<br />
Close the lids on the wondering eyes,<br />
Deep and blue as the summer skies.<br />
Far in the west the sunset dies:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep, little one, sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep, little one, sleep,<br />
Thou art more than the world to me,<br />
All my life shall be spent for thee,<br />
Till Nature comes with her lullaby:<br />

<h3>
The Bird in the Night.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Once long ago, a summer night in June,<br />
When earth lay still beneath a waning moon.<br />
And never sound or rustle in the wood<br />
Save the dull thunder of a far-off flood,<br />
Hurling itself in ruin to the deep<br />
O'er a great gulf, I lay and strove to sleep.<br />
The stars were out; I watched with aching eye<br />
Their slow grand march across a cloudless sky,<br />
But rest came not; when suddenly I heard,<br />
Far in the slumbering forest, one lone bird<br />
Give three sweet calls, as if in pure delight<br />
To fling its soul in music through the night!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Like a cool hand upon a fevered brow<br />
Came that dear song; all fear had vanished now,<br />
Steady my pulse, sunk in oblivion's arms<br />
Forgetful as a child of past alarms.<br />
Ye who have doubts&mdash;who is it has them not?<br />
Ye who have fears, and troubled anxious thought,<br />
When the storm lulls, will, if ye list aright,<br />
Hear a bird singing in your darkest night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
Nescio at Felix.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
One night, with some unquietness and dread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fear of boding ill within my soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fell to sleep; before me, like a scroll,<br />
Lay bare the coming years.  In them I read,<br />
Clear writ as in a book or chart, the vast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Futurity, with all its joy and grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success and failure, love, hate, unbelief<br />
And faith, and that blind parting at the last;<br />
Whereat my soul recoiled, nor could it bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse on so much labor; better far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to have been, or else to be perchance<br />
Like a dumb brute, existence without care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or consciousness; but with the morning star<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke, and thanked God for my ignorance.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem"><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
To My Indian Pipe.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Thou, with the black stone stem, what of the past?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the cunning hands that fashioned thee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the stern brown lips that placidly<br />
Drew comfort from thee 'neath the towering mast<br />
Of some old pine; or, patient to the last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toiled over thee?  Perchance thou wert a god<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worshipped and feared by those whose light feet trod<br />
The dim green aisles of that cathedral vast:<br />
But now thine incense rises, and I see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The still north land, and hear the otter dive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapids calling, and the great trout leap;<br />
And smoking here it seemeth like to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if some dead hands touched the hands alive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In token of the fellowship we keep.<br />
</p>

<h3>
Advenit Amor.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Silence again, sweetheart, the shadows grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watch the white stars climb into the sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the dull rapids' softened lullaby<br />
In smothered thunder, brooding sweet and low;<br />
Catch in the east the pallid silver glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a new moon, that floating pure and clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In perfect promise of the fuller sphere,<br />
Dips this dim world in glory, mounting slow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Not always had the heavens such a charm;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the rapids were not half so sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind had not such rythmic melody,<br />
Till, Love, love came, and fanned the cold 'heart warm,<br />
Attuned to music chords still incomplete,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set the whole night whispering of thee.<br />

A Song of Life.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came through the fields of air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came through the silent night,<br />
Borne low on a sigh of a western breeze,<br />
Like the far-off voice of tumultuous seas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tempest's waning might.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the wonderful song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made its home in my breast;<br />
The music of all the world was there,<br />
it hushed all murmur of pain or care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A psalm of infinite rest.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever more clear and pure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever more strong and sweet;<br />
Till some kindred chord in the outer air,<br />
In response to the melody throbbing there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang "come" to my restless feet.<br />

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the mysterious call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rose and followed it straight,<br />
O'er many a mount, through many a dale,<br />
Past blazing meadow and shady vale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sunset's roseate gate.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never a halt or stop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the song I could scarcely hear;<br />
It had sunk to an echo, faint and dim,<br />
Of some melodious wonderful hymn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I knew that the end was near.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower and fainter yet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more imperceptible still,<br />
As I journeyed on; but I climbed one day,<br />
With courage that faltered, so steep the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crest of a long, long hill.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, far as the eye could scan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was naught but the fathomless deep,<br />
While down at the crag's great base the waves<br />
Crept in and out of the blind black caves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispered ever of sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my hair, 'twas white;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hands were bony and long;<br />
The years of my life had vanished and fled,<br />
Though they seemed but days that had quickly sped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuit of that fugitive song.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then out of the ocean's heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came swelling a grand refrain,<br />
And through it there pulsed an angelic voice:<br />
"Now weary mortal, rejoice, rejoice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast come to thy rest again;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The song that stole into thy breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the song of an earthly love,<br />
It was but an echo, faint, yet true,<br />
Of that mightier song that is pealing through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musical halls above."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then prone on the storm-swept bluff,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My face to a golden sky,<br />
The breezes played with my toil-stained dress,<br />
And I waited and prayed in my loneliness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste of the worst, and die.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So out of the void, a sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the vast dim space, a breath<br />
That fanned the flickering flame of life<br />
Till it flared, went out, and ended the strife&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slept, and the sleep was Death.<br />
</p>

<h3>
Voices.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
My heart within me stirred with a nameless trouble and dread<br />
Of evil that should betide, and a voice in my bosom said:<br />
"What pause from this weary toiling, what end to this endless strife?<br />
The day bringeth naught but labor, and death follows hard upon life;<br />
Ever I see the false one triumphing over the true,<br />
The foul outbalance the fair, the many oppressed by the few.<br />
Answer me, mortal master, after the battle is fought,<br />
Six feet of earth for a couch, mayhap a stone, then&mdash;what?"<br />
How could I answer my heart?  When suddenly in my breast<br />
There fell a hush as of a wind sinking at eve to rest;<br />
The voice within me was stilled, and I felt its murmuring cease,<br />
For somewhere out of infinity an angel had whispered "Peace."<br />

<h3>
Fifty Years Hence.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Again 'twas night, and on the wave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon in silver lay;<br />
Vanished had all the petty cares<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And troubles of the day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
No sound in all the wide expanse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No rustle in the wood,<br />
Save when some evening zephyr stirred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whispers on the flood.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Breathless and motionless she stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unquestioningly dumb,<br />
Twas as a world were waiting there&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for God to come.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Then back, through long dead years, her heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winged its reflective flight,<br />
To ponder childhood's days again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse on past delight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
A mist came o'er her eyes, her gaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had spanned the wide gulf o'er,<br />
Old voices spake, old scenes recurred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old friendship lived once more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Serene the skies, no fear, no care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tempest and no storm,<br />
Wild birds and sunshine in the air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And south winds sweet and warm.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Ah! perfect youth, ah! perfect life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free as a cloud above,<br />
Ah! fount whence spring the purest hopes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence flows the purest love.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
For if ambition's wildest dreams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success should crown, in truth<br />
The cup she holds were tasteless still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the wine of youth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
All silent now, ah! for the power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again those tales to tell,<br />
To wake afresh those sleeping chords<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That memory loves so well.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
But, echoing clear and low, those notes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That song, we still may hear,<br />
For faintly yet its music floats<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In old age atmosphere.<br />
</p>

<h3>
Farewell to the White Canoe.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
The summer is dead, for the air is chill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And winter is nigh again;<br />
The maples ablaze on each ruddy hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are dripping with crimson rain;<br />
Black dusk comes hard on the steps or day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of the south that blew,<br />
Has turned to the north, and bids me say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to the White Canoe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
How wildly she leapt at each measured stroke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mounted the curling swell;<br />
How the white foam hung at her bows like smoke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the great waves rose and fell;<br />
No terror for her could a tempest find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wrath in a frowning sky;<br />
Her birth was the union of sea and wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her life is a mystery.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
She swam like a ghost through the ghostly night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bowed but to her as queen;<br />
She sped like a wraith in the silver light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a spirit of things unseen:<br />
As a leaf in the autumn she sank to sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By babbling ripples caressed,<br />
And lay in the arms of the cradling deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the river's responsive breast.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The summer is dead, and alas! no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May we wander, alone and free,<br />
By still deep pools and the shadowy shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rapids' soft lullaby;<br />
Farewell, farewell, to the peace that lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that solitude deep and blue;<br />
An answering voice from the great stream sighs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell to the White Canoe."<br />
